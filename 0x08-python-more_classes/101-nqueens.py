"""Solves the N-queens puzzle.
Determines all possible solutions to placing N
N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.
Example:
    $ ./101-nqueens.py N
N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
Attributes:
    board (list): A list of lists representing the chessboard.
    solutions (list): A list of lists containing solutions.
Solutions are represented in the format [[r, c], [r, c], [r, c], [r, c]]
where `r` and `c` represent the row and column, respectively, where a
queen must be placed on the chessboard.
